# A note about precision

We have several different implementations of êŸ»LIP (Python, PyTorch, C++, and CUDA) and we have tried to make
the implementations as similar as possible. However, there are several facts about these that make it very hard
to get perfect matches between the implementations.
These include:
1. Our computations are made using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic.
2. The order of operations matter, with respect to the result.
    * We are using functions from `numpy` and `pytorch`, and these may be implemented differently. Even computing the mean of an
      array can give different results because of this.
    * As an example, if a 2D filter implementation's outer loop is on `x` and the inner loop is on `y`, that will in the majority
      of cases give a different floating-point result compared to have the outer loop be `y` and the inner `x`.
4. GPUs attempt to try to use fused multiply-and-add (FMA) operations, i.e., `a*b+c`, as much as possible. These are faster, but the entire
   operation is also computed at higher precision. Since the CPU implementation may not use FMA, this is another source of difference
   between implementations.
5. Depending on compiler flags, `sqrt()` may be computed using lower precision on GPUs.
6. We have changed to using separable filters for faster performance, but that also gives rise to small errors.
   In our tests, we have therefore updated the `images/correct_*.{png,exr}` images.

That said, we have tried to make our implementations as close to each other as we could. There may still be differences.
